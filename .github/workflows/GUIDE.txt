âœ… Instructions to Set Up Terraform CI with GitHub Actions
Create a directory named .github/workflows in your project root.

Inside that directory, create a file named terraform-ci.yml.

Configure the workflow to run on:

Pushes to the main branch

Pull requests to the main branch

Use the official GitHub Action to:

Check out your code (actions/checkout)

Set up Terraform (hashicorp/setup-terraform)

Add the following Terraform steps:

terraform init (with backend config file)

terraform fmt -check

terraform validate

terraform plan -input=false

Do NOT include terraform apply in this CI step (save for later).

Commit and push the workflow file to your repo.

Verify in GitHub:

Go to the "Actions" tab

Confirm that the workflow runs successfully on push or PR to main
